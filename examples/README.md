# Sparkfun GPIO Examples Reference
Below is a brief summary of each of the example programs included in this repository. To report a bug in any of these examples or to request a new feature or example [submit an issue in our GitHub issues.](https://github.com/sparkfun/qwiic_gpio_py/issues). 

NOTE: Any numbering of examples is to retain consistency with the Arduino library from which this was ported. 

## Qwiic Gpio Ex1A Write
This script sets up a GPIO 0 as an output and toggles
   the output HIGH and LOW.
 
   This device sinks current. When an output is LOW then current will flow.

## Qwiic Gpio Ex1B Write Port
This script flips all 8 outputs on and off every second.

## Qwiic Gpio Ex2A Read
This script allows the user to read a value from GPIO 0
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Qwiic Gpio Ex2B Read Port
This script allows the user to read the status of all 8 GPIO simultaneously
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Qwiic Gpio Ex3A Inversion
This script shows how to invert the input signal on a pin
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Qwiic Gpio Ex3B Inversion Port
This script shows how to invert the input signal on multiple pins
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
